    "This solution merges the two lists in place, i.e., no new list is created. First, initialize two new variables to track the ‘current index’ of both the lists to zero. Then, compare the current elements of both. If the current element of the first list is greater than the current element of the second list, insert the current element of the second list in place of the current element of the first list and increment both index variables by 1. Note that the insert operation is done using the built-in insert function. However, if the current element of the first list is smaller than the current element of the second list, then only increment the index variable of the first list by 1. Continue this until the end of one of the lists is reached, i.e., until one of the index variables is greater than or equal to the length of its respective list. After that, if the index of the second list is smaller than the length of the list, extend the first list by the second one from that index until the end.\n",

Both lists are not traversed separately so we cannot say that complexity is (m+n). The shorter of the two lengths is traversed in the while loop. Also, the insert function gets called when the if-condition is true. In the worst-case, the second list has all the elements that are smaller than the elements of the first list. In this case, the complexity will be O(mn). Note that if m > n, we have O(mn), otherwise the complexity is O(n^2).\n",

    "Explanation: The 3rd smallest number among all the arrays is 7.\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution #\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem follows the K-way merge pattern and we can follow a similar approach as discussed in Merge K Sorted Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start merging all the arrays, but instead of inserting numbers into a merged list, we will keep count to see how many elements have been inserted in the merged list. Once that count is equal to ‘K’, we have found our required number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big difference from Merge K Sorted Lists is that in this problem, the input is a list of arrays compared to LinkedLists. This means that when we want to push the next number in the heap we need to know what the index of the current number in the current array was. To handle this, we will need to keep track of the array and the element indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we’ll be going through at most ‘K’ elements among all the arrays, \n",
    "and we will remove/add one element in the heap in each step, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K*logM) where ‘M’ is the total number of input arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity #\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity will be O(M) because, at any time, our min-heap will be storing one number from all the ‘M’ input arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar Problems #\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 1: Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the median number among all arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: This problem is similar to our parent problem with K=Median. So if there are ‘N’ total numbers in all the arrays we need to find the K’th minimum number where K=N/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2: Given a list of ‘K’ sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: This problem is similar to Merge K Sorted Lists except that the input is a list of arrays compared to LinkedLists. To handle this, we can use a similar approach as discussed in our parent problem by keeping a track of the array and the element indices.\n",

    "Another algorithm is to serialize the tree in any two depth-first traversal orders e.g. pre-order and in-order traversal. Remember that we can construct a tree (or deserialize) if two of its depth-first orders are given. For integer data this approach is almost similar to the above algorithm in terms of space and time complexity.\n",

    "Problem Statement #\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of investment projects with their respective profits, we need to find the most profitable projects. We are given an initial capital and are allowed to invest only in a fixed number of projects. Our goal is to choose projects that give us the maximum profit. Write a function that returns the maximum total capital after selecting the most profitable projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital. Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Project Capitals=[0,1,2], Project Profits=[1,2,3], Initial Capital=1, Number of Projects=2\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With initial capital of ‘1’, we will start the second project which will give us profit of ‘2’. Once we selected our first project, our total capital will become 3 (profit + initial capital).\n",
    "- With ‘3’ capital, we will select the third project, which will give us ‘3’ profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of the two projects, our total capital will be 6 (1+2+3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: Project Capitals=[0,1,2,3], Project Profits=[1,2,3,5], Initial Capital=0, Number of Projects=3\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With ‘0’ capital, we can only select the first project, bringing out capital to 1.\n",
    "- Next, we will select the second project, which will bring our capital to 3.\n",
    "- Next, we will select the fourth project, giving us a profit of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the three projects, our total capital will be 8 (1+2+5).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution #\n",
    "\n",
    "While selecting projects we have two constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can select a project only when we have the required capital.\n",
    "- There is a maximum limit on how many projects we can select.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don’t have any constraint on time, we should choose a project, among the projects for which we have enough capital, which gives us a maximum profit. Following this greedy approach will give us the best solution.\n",

    "While selecting a project, we will do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find all the projects that we can choose with the available capital.\n",
    "- From the list of projects in the 1st step, choose the project that gives us a maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow the Two Heaps approach similar to Find the Median of a Number Stream. Here are the steps of our algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add all project capitals to a min-heap, so that we can select a project with the smallest capital requirement.\n",
    "- Go through the top projects of the min-heap and filter the projects that can be completed within our available capital. Insert the profits of all these projects into a max-heap, so that we can choose a project with the maximum profit.\n",
    "- Finally, select the top project of the max-heap for investment.\n",

    "The intersection function will return all the elements that are common between two linked lists.\n",
